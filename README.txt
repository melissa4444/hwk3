## Program was written using Sublime Text on my Mac OS that has Ruby installed. 

Program Structure: 
	/bin/main.rb
		/lib/board.rb
		/lib/cell.rb
		/lib/game_logic.rb
		/lib/player.rb

 To Run: open in terminal make sure the directory is like: 
 /Users/melissan/Desktop/fall-2021/OO-design-683/assignment-3/hwk3/bin/main.rb

RUN: ruby /Users/melissan/Desktop/fall-2021/OO-design-683/assignment-3/hwk3/bin/main.rb

I took a lot of references to the Java program that allowed me to achieve this design. This project was truly needed to further understand the design of the ruby language. 


As the program grew I wanted to figure out a way to make it more organized and efficient so I separated the program into classes by using require_relative './'
